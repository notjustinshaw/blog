# Forgetting Fees

The rusty school bus groaned as it crawled its way up the hill, a trail of bumper-to-bumper traffic behind it. As it shook to a stop, I eagerly jumped off and sprinted down the gravel road to my grandmas house. The zippers on my backpack slowly unzipped as the large bag flopped from side to side.

Being born in the year 2000 puts me square in the middle of gen Z (people born between 1995–2009). But unlike many of my peers, I know what a VHS tape is. I remember running down that gravel road to my grandparents house to plug in the floppy disk of Captain Keen to their Dell XPS D300.

## Part I — The Invisible Hand

I had just started kindergarten when Apple announced the iPod Nano would replace the short-lived mini. Then came the iPod Touch and later the iPhone which connected our generation like no generation before us.

The growing diversity of apps on the App Store brought with it a digital mindset of abundance. When you have so many options to chose from, convenience becomes a necessity. The difference between an easy-to-use interface and one that is clumsy or cumbersome is trivial. It’s like when a non-native speaker uses an incorrect sentence structure: it just feels weird.

This divide is highlighted most in smartphone usage. A recent survey found that 83% of gen Z teens claim to use an iPhone while only 9% claim to use an Android. This statistic is shocking.

Unless you’re a digital native.

The use of iMessage has become so prevalent that having an Android is a liability that may get you ostracized from your group’s communications. Either by brilliant design or complete accident, iMessage only works if everyone in the group has an iPhone. The alternative is a headache of nameless group chats and spontaneously created duplicate chats that render the cross-platform use of iMessage useless.

There was a brief time when third-party apps were on the rise and there was hope that a convenient way to communicate would emerge. Skype almost got there, Snapchat came close, but nobody could seem to beat the built-in, easy-to-use nature of Apple’s iMessage.

Perhaps the headache of mixed-platform group chats gets muddled in the minds of other generations with the overall complexity associated with maneuvering an iPhone. But for a digital native, the benefit to an iPhone-only group is clear. Even if that means paying a pretty penny for the new iPhone, what is convenient for the group is in your own self-interest. In this sense, convenience has become the digital reincarnation of the invisible hand that drives the digital market.

## Part II — Digital Payments

I remember watching my mother sit at our kitchen table pouring over her old receipts and anxiously tapping on her jumbo-sized calculator as her glasses slid down to the tip of her nose. It was foreign to me, why anybody would want to do something so onerous and inconvenient. It was only a matter of time.

As my generation grew older we soon had money to spend, we turned our backs to the old way of doing things. First on the chopping block were checks: the best “analog” way to securely send money to someone elsewhere meeting face-to-face isn’t viable. If you just send them cash, it could get stolen. But only the person you addressed the check to could collect the money, so it was worthless to anybody else.

Then PayPal killed checks. PayPal digitized the long-distance transfer of funds through the Internet. It was more secure, and it happened almost instantly. But if you wanted to use your credit card, they would take a 2.9% +$0.30 transaction fee.

Then Venmo killed cash. Deep into the social media craze, Venmo created a half-social-media, half-peer-to-peer-payment-system that spread like wildfire across digital natives for one simple reason: convenience. It’s hard to break a twenty with physical cash, but it’s trivial on a digital platform like Venmo. Moreover, Venmo caught fire among gen Z because we all were getting our first debit cards at this point and transferring funds via debit card was free. Like iMessage, it’s socially taboo to not have Venmo. What is digitally convenient for the group is also in your own social self-interest.

## Part III — Blockchain & Fees

It is said that middlemen are the grease that keeps the system moving. In that frame of mind, referring to middlemen as “friction” is a horrible misnomer as removing that “friction” would slow the system to a halt.

But computers are also middlemen. In truth, computers are the epitome of middlemen in that they facilitate the smooth functioning of a market and only require electricity as payment.

Blockchain technology, in particular, represents an interesting avenue for such “friction-reducing” machines. Just as the internet cannot be confined to just an email transfer protocol, blockchain is bigger than Bitcoin or Etherium. It would not be a far leap from current technology to envision a coinless blockchain with nodes at every point-of-sale register where the fee for any transaction is micro-cents that would revolutionize the way digital payments are processed.

The architecture of this coinless blockchain that tracks USD transactions down eight decimal places could be facilitated by scalable nodes at every register consuming electricity when and where it already would be. There would be no need for a central server so long as you can find a way to prune the growing list of unspent transactions. In this world, there will be no cash or cards or checks. You can pay by tapping your phone or watch or glasses.

Nowhere in this system will you find the need to collect a greedy 2.9% of the transaction because each validating machine makes a profit through the sheer volume of nodes it validates. Best of all, some if not most of this technology exists today. So just like PayPal killed checks and Venmo killed cash, Blockchain has the potential to kill fees.
